# Signature Verification Models

This repository contains pre-trained signature verification models on three datasets: BhSig260Hindi, BhSig260Bengali, and Cedar.

## Dataset Information

### BhSig260Hindi
This dataset consists of 160 Hindi signatures collected from different individuals. It is primarily used for Hindi signature verification tasks.

### BhSig260Bengali
This dataset comprises 100 Bengali signatures obtained from various individuals. It is primarily used for Bengali signature verification tasks.

### Cedar
The Cedar dataset contains a collection of signatures captured from multiple writers. It serves as a benchmark for signature verification research and development.

## Trained Models

The repository includes the following trained models:

### Model1_SCNN
Signature verification model based on SCNN architecture.

### Model2_SigNetSiamese
Signature verification model based on the Siamese network architecture using the SigNet model.

### Model3_Resnet50
Signature verification model based on the ResNet-50 architecture.

### Model4_Resnet50Siamese
